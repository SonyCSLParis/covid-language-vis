<h1>The COVID-19 Project</h1>
<p>The outbreak of the Corona virus has affected the world in a substantial way. Here at Sony CSL we've decided to pool together our talents and time to try and understand what is happening better.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://csl.sony.fr/projects-language/">Language Team</a> at SonyCSL has varied and extensive skills in computational linguistics and natural language processing. </p>
<p>This website represents a pooling together of insights we have acquired on COVID-19 from a variety of sources. We are a diverse, international lab, interested in understanding the effects of COVID-19 in different regions and countries across France, The United Kingdom, Italy and other countries.   </p>
<h2>Our Focus</h2>
<p>Our fundamental aim with the project is to explore: </p>
<ul>
<li>What people are sharing.</li>
<li>How this changes over time.</li>
<li>How this was influenced by government and societal measures.</li>
</ul>
<p>COVID-19 changed the world very quickly and we are still trying to work out how and what the repercussions might be.</p>
