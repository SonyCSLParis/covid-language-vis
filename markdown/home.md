#The COVID-19 Project

The outbreak of the Corona virus has affected the world in a substantial way. Here at Sony CSL we've decided to pool together our talents and time to try and understand what is happening better.

The [Language Team](https://csl.sony.fr/projects-language/) at SonyCSL has varied and extensive skills in computational linguistics and natural language processing. 

This website represents a pooling together of insights we have acquired on COVID-19 from a variety of sources. We are a diverse, international lab, interested in understanding the effects of COVID-19 in different regions and countries across France, The United Kingdom, Italy and other countries.   

## Our Focus

Our fundamental aim with the project is to explore: 

- What people are sharing.
- How this changes over time.
- How this was influenced by government and societal measures.

COVID-19 changed the world very quickly and we are still trying to work out how and what the repercussions might be.
