# Twitter Data

Almost as soon as the coronavirus became a global talking-point various datasets were created to try and document and explore the phenomena. In particular [this twitter dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07372) began collecting data.

Twitter serves as an informal basis for diffusing news and opinions. As such it captures the focus of attention of its users.

The following visualisations are the word clouds that are a ubiquitous way to capture what appears in text. But there are two additional elements. Firstly regions are depicted and secondly the word clouds are shown across weeks.

The outer areas of the regions depict the overall words that are used while within each regions the most distinctive words used by those regions are shown.
This way we can capture both the global words captured to all regions and the peculiarities of each region.
